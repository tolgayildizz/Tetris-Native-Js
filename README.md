# Welcome to Tetris Game!



Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian game designer Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnovv The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport. The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines (the maximum simultaneous clearance number) are cleared at once.

Tetris was the first entertainment software to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States, where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The game is a popular use of tetrominoes, the four-element case of polyominoes, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907. (The name for these figures was given by the mathematician Solomon W. Golomb in 1953.)

This legendary game, born in the Soviet Union, is a game that is remembered not only by computer scientists but also by every child who owns a game console.
